# Quiz

In this homework assignment, I created a code quiz app to display my knowledge of iterating through an array using forEach loop, transitioning to the next question by using the ++ to increment, and I created a different function for each of the things I needed to accomplish, in a way that made sense to me.

To use app, click start on the quiz and click on one of the choice answer buttons! There is not a next button, so clicking on an answer will take you to the next question.

Future improvements for this app will include implementation of a timer and highscores page, as well as styling.
